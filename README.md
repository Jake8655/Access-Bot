<p>Access-Bot is a <a href="https://discord.com">Discord</a> bot that brings more <b>security</b> and <b>member filtering</b> to your Discord servers. It let's you ensure that all users have carefully <i>read the rules</i>.</p>

# Installation
This is a **self-host** bot, that means you will have to *download* the files above and *host* the bot yourself. In order to host the bot please **follow the instructions below**:
<ol>
  <li>Install <a href="https://nodejs.org">Node.js</a>.</li>
  <li>Download the bot's files from <a href="https://github.com/Jake8655/Access-Bot">the github page</a>.</li>
  <li>Create a <a href="https://discord.com/developers">Discord bot</a> and paste the bot's token into the <b>config.json</b> file.</li>
  <li>Customize the bot to your likings.</li>
  <li>Run the <b>start.bat</b> file or the <b>start.vbs</b> file. (Basically the difference is that the vbs file can run in the background.)</li>
</ol>
<p><b>If you get stuck during the installation feel free to get in touch with <a href="https://discord.com/users/300963276223807488">me</a> through Discord.</b> I usually respond in a day or less.</p>
